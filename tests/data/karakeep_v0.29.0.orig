# New Features 🚀

- Collaborative lists are here! (#2146, #2152)
  - You can now invite collaborators to your lists and manage their access levels between viewers and editors.
  - This was the most requested feature on the roadmap, and it's now here!
- Automated bookmark backups you can schedule once and forget (#2182)
  - Currently it only captures non-asset bookmarks, but I'm planning to include lists, tags, and other metadata in the future.
- Search gets autocomplete so you can find the right filters and terms faster (#2178)
- Highlights overhaul: notes + search bar on web, plus a dedicated highlights page on mobile (#2154, #2155, #2156, #2157)
- Mobile catches up with smart list creation and an all-tags screen (#2153, #2163)
- Crawler domain rate limiting to avoid getting throttled by external sites (#2115)
  - Configure it with `CRAWLER_DOMAIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` and `CRAWLER_DOMAIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`.
- Import from MyMind (#2138)

# UX Improvements ✨

- Sidebar typography and colors should feel nicer (specially in dark mode).
- Page titles are now correctly displayed in the browser tabs.
- We have a friendlier 404 page for bookmarks/lists that don't exist.
- You can now see stats about the source of your bookmarks in the usage stats page (extension, web app, mobile app, etc).

# Fixes 🔧

- Prompts lazily load `js-tiktoken` which should cut between 70-150MB of karakeep's memory usage (#2176)
- The edit dialog wasn't correctly showing the extracted text from assets, this is now fixed (#2181).
- IP validation allowlisting now allows bypassing all domains by setting `CRAWLER_ALLOWED_INTERNAL_HOSTNAMES` to `.`.
- Fix a worker crash when hitting invalid URLs with proxy enabled.

# For Developers 🛠️
- GET `/api/version` endpoint for getting server version (#2167)
- More visibility: HTTP status Prometheus counters, failed_permanent worker metric, and system metrics on web/worker containers (#2117, #2107)
- Documentation updates for `LOG_LEVEL` and Raycast links (#2166, #1923) by @aa-ko and @fivestones
